# rockPaperScissors
First JavaScript project for the odin project. Demonstrated what I've learned and did some problem solving skills to have my project work as intended.

Used multiple functions and nested functions to make it work.
Used if else function for human vs. computer choice and declare the winner.
Used for loop to make it automatically run 5x
